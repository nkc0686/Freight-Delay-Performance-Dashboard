# Data Modeling (Power BI)

This folder contains key logic used in the data modeling layer of the Freight Delay Performance Dashboard.

Included:
- **DAX Measures**: Calculated fields used for custom summaries, slicer behavior, and grouped aggregations
- **Power Query (M code)**: Steps used to clean and reshape data prior to loading
- **Data Relationships**: Lookup tables and custom summary tables used to enable 1:m joins and slicer functionality

Each file is either a code snippet (`.txt` or `.m`) or a screenshot taken from the Power BI environment.
