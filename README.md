# Freight Delay Performance Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

This project analyzes freight delivery delays using a manually constructed dataset and demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used together to uncover operational insights.

## 🔍 Overview
This dashboard project focuses on:
- Identifying average delivery delays by carrier and dispatcher
- Tracking daily delay trends
- Summarizing delivery status performance
- Visualizing overall on-time delivery percentage
- Filtering by terminal location

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
The dataset used in this project was manually created for educational and portfolio purposes only. It does **not** represent real operational performance data from any company.

## 📁 Project Files
- `freight_delay_data.csv`: Main dataset used for the slicer and model inputs
- `carrier_delay_summary.csv`: Summary of average delay by carrier
- `dispatcher_delay_summary.csv`: Summary of total loads and delays by dispatcher
- `daily_delay_trend.csv`: Daily average delay trend
- `on_time_delivery_breakdown.csv`: Delivery status counts and percentages

## 📊 Visualizations (Power BI Desktop)
1. **Average Delay by Carrier** (Bar Chart)
2. **Late Loads by Dispatcher** (Column Chart)
3. **Daily Average Delay Trend** (Line Chart)
4. **Delivery Status Breakdown** (Donut Chart)
5. **On-Time Delivery Percentage** (Card)
6. **Terminal Filter** (Slicer)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Google BigQuery Sandbox** for SQL-based data summarization
- **Power BI Desktop** (Free version)
- **Manual CSV generation** based on SQL outputs
- **Screenshots and documentation** due to sandbox/reporting limitations

## 📝 Additional Notes
- BigQuery SQL scripts are saved and included in the documentation.
- This repo includes screenshots of each chart due to limitations with publishing dashboards without Power BI Pro.

## ✅ What You Can Learn From This Repo
- How to move from raw freight data to actionable logistics insights
- How to use BigQuery SQL to prepare data for visualization
- How to build clean and interactive dashboards in Power BI Desktop
- How to creatively document projects when publishing is restricted

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Extend the dataset to simulate monthly performance
- Add benchmarking visuals for service level comparisons
- Convert into a more interactive public-facing dashboard once licensing allows
