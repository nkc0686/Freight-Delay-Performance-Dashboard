# SQL Queries

The SQL queries for this project were originally written and executed in the Google BigQuery Sandbox environment.

Due to sandbox limitations, queries were not initially saved as `.sql` files. However, the four key summary queries used in the Power BI dashboard have now been recreated and saved in this folder for reference and reuse.

### ✅ Summary of Files

- `01_carrier_summary.sql` – Aggregates average delay per carrier.
- `02_dispatcher_summary.sql` – Aggregates average delay per dispatcher.
- `03_ontime_breakdown.sql` – Shows on-time vs. delayed load percentages.
- `04_delay_trend.sql` – Tracks average delay over time for line chart visuals.
