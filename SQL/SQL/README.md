# SQL Queries

The SQL queries for this project were written and executed using the Google BigQuery Sandbox environment.

Due to sandbox limitations, queries were not saved as `.sql` files. Instead:
- Screenshots of the queries and results were taken for documentation.
- Query results were exported into Excel files.
- These files were then used as data sources in the Power BI dashboard.

📁 Query screenshots are located in the [`/screenshots`](../screenshots) folder.
📁 Output Excel files are located in the [`/data`](../data) folder.
